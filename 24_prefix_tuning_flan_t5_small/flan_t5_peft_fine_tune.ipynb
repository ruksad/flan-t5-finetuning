        "*   **PEFT Method Efficacy:** LoRA consistently demonstrated slightly superior performance for both classification and summarization tasks compared to Prompt and Prefix tuning methods based on the evaluated metrics. This suggests LoRA might be the most effective PEFT approach for the models and datasets used in this context.\n",
        "*   **Further Optimization & Analysis:** Given LoRA's strong performance, it would be beneficial to further explore its hyperparameter space or consider combining it with other techniques to push performance boundaries. Additionally, a deeper qualitative analysis of summarization outputs from LoRA versus other methods could provide insights beyond ROUGE scores.\n"
